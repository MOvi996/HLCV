# HLCV - High-Level Computer Vision

This is a combined repository that starts from processing visual data with classical techniques, and goes on to deep-learning concepts like MLPs and CNNs for object identification, Vision Transformers and CNN-LSTMs for image-captioning.  

The model classes are defined in src/models.
The training scripts can be found in src/trainers.
The implementations and demos can be found in src/notebooks.
